# Finger Exercise Prompt: 
# Assume 3 variables are already defined for you: a, b, and c. 
# Create a variable called total that adds a and b then multiplies the result by c.
# Include a last line in your code to print the value: print(total)

#assigned values for a, b and c just for clarity/ making the program run.
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
total = (a + b)*c
print(total)
